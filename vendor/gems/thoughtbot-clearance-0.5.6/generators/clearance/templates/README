Ok, enough fancy automatic stuff. Time for some old school monkey copy-pasting.

1. For any other file(s) that you already had and didn't want to overwrite, add 
the corresponding Clearance module. They are namespaced exactly like the 
directory structure of a Rails app.

Application controller example:

    class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
      include Clearance::App::Controllers::ApplicationController
    end

User model example:

    class User < ActiveRecord::Base
      include Clearance::App::Models::User
    end

User test example:

    class UserTest < ActiveSupport::TestCase
      include Clearance::Test::Unit::UserTest
    end

2. You need to define HOST constant in your environments files. 
In config/environments/test.rb and config/environments/development.rb it can be:

    HOST = "localhost"

In production.rb it must be the actual host your application is deployed to. 
The constant is used by mailers to generate URLs in emails.

In config/environment.rb:

    DO_NOT_REPLY = "donotreply@example.com"

3. Clearance depends on root_url, so please make sure that it is defined to
*something* in your config/routes.rb:

    map.root :controller => 'home'
