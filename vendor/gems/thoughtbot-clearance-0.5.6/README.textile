h2. Wiki

Most information regarding Clearance is on the "Github Wiki":http://wiki.github.com/thoughtbot/clearance.

h2. Integration with Suspenders

Clearance is based on the same conventions and tools as "Suspenders":http://github.com/thoughtbot/suspenders If you use it, you already have some configuration mentioned below.

h2. Gem installation (Rails 2.1+)

In config/environment.rb:

    config.gem "thoughtbot-clearance", 
      :lib     => 'clearance', 
      :source  => 'http://gems.github.com', 
      :version => '0.5.5'

In config/environments/test.rb:

    config.gem 'thoughtbot-shoulda',
      :lib     => 'shoulda',
      :source  => "http://gems.github.com", 
      :version => '2.10.0'
    config.gem 'thoughtbot-factory_girl',
      :lib     => 'factory_girl',
      :source  => "http://gems.github.com", 
      :version => '1.2.0'

Then:

    rake gems:install
    rake gems:unpack 
    rake gems:install RAILS_ENV=test
    rake gems:unpack  RAILS_ENV=test

h2. The generator

Make sure the development database exists and run the generator:

    script/generate clearance

A number of files will be created and instructions will be printed.

You may already have some of these files. Don't worry. You'll be asked if you want to overwrite them.

h2. Features

If you are using Cucumber on your application Clearance comes with a feature generator:

    script/generate clearance_features

All of the files generated should be new with the exception of the features/support/paths.rb file.  If you have not modified your paths.rb then you will be okay to replace it with this one.  If you need to keep your paths.rb file then you will need to add these locations in your paths.rb manually:

    def path_to(page_name)
      case page_name
       ...
      when /the sign up page/i
       new_user_path
      when /the sign in page/i
       new_session_path 
      when /the password reset request page/i
       new_password_path
      ...
    end
