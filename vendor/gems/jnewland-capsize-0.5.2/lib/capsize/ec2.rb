      Remember that these keypairs are only usable if you have the private key material stored locally
      and you specify this keypair as part of the run instances command.  Only then will you be able to
      take advantage of logging into remote servers using public key authentication.  This command

      Create and store a new keypair.
      This command will generate a new keypair for you on EC2 and will also
      save a local copy of your private key in the filepath specified by
      KEY_DIR and KEY_NAME.  By default the keypair will be named the
      same as your Capistrano application's name, and the private key will
      be stored in your capsize config dir.  If a keypair already exists
      on the EC2 servers or locally with the same name it will not be
      overwritten.

      WARNING : Keypair private keys should be protected the same as passwords.
      If you have specified a key_name to use when running instances anyone who
      has access to your keypair private key file contents and who knows the
      public DNS name of your servers may be able to login to those servers
      without providing a password.  Use caution when storing the private key file

      deletion of your keypair before the action will proceed.

      Open an SSH shell to instance_id.
      This command makes it easy to open an interactive SSH session with one

      files, or pass in INSTANCE_ID='i-123456' to this task and an SSH
      connection to the public DNS name for that instance will be started.
      SSH is configured to use try the public key pair associated with
      your application for authentication assuming you started your instance
      to be associated with that key_name.  The option StrictHostKeyChecking=no
      is passed to your local SSH command to avoid prompting the user regarding
      adding the remote host signature to their SSH known_hosts file as these
      server signatures will typically change often anyway in the EC2 environment.

      Associate an elastic IP address with an instance.
      If the IP address is currently assigned to another instance, the IP address
      is assigned to the new instance.

      You must supply both a public_ip (this is the elastic IP address you want to assign)
      and an instance_id (this is the instance to which you want to assign the address)

      You can associate an elastic IP with an instance by doing one of the following:
      - Define these variables in deploy.rb with "set :public_ip, '123.1.2.3'; set :instance_id, 'i-12312312';"
      - Override this on the command line with "cap ec2:addresses:associate PUBLIC_IP='123.1.2.3' INSTANCE_ID='i-12312312'"
      - A combination of the above.
