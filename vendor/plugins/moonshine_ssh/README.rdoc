= Moonshine_SSH

== A plugin for Moonshine[http://github.com/railsmachine/moonshine]

This plugin provides a few security improvements for your default SSH
configuration. It also gives you the ability to easily customize your
settings. Browse through the sshd_config in the <tt>templates/</tt> directory
to see the available settings.

The new configuration file is tested before it's used, so there's less
chance that you'll accidentally lock yourself out.
