h1. Count Von Count

h2. Disclaimer

The code in here still needs lots of love.

h2. Installation

<pre><code>script/plugin install git://github.com/toastyapps/count_von_count.git
script/generate count_migration
rake db:migrate
</code></pre>

h2. Usage

From inside your controller action you may now do
<pre><code>@post = Post.find(params[:id])
@post.update_view_count(request)
</code></pre>

You also get a view_count helper method
<code>@post.view_count # 10</code>

If you want to store the total view count on the model add a field called "total_view_count" to your model

You may also add IP addresses to a blacklist so that they are not recorded by adding this to an initializer
<code>CountVonCount.blacklist = %w{127.0.0.1}</code>
