== PutYourselfOn.com

This the Ruby on Rails application powering PutYourselfOn.com.

The project has git submodules for plugins and the capistrano / moonshine libraries.

== Bootstrapping

Add a config/database.yml for the project.  Railsmachine deployment takes care of this, so don't worry about checking a new one in.

Add RVM to the project.  Here's a sample:

rvm 1.8.7@pyo

Then you'll need to install rails (and rack):

gem install rails -v 2.3.3
gem install mysql

You can then load the schema:

rake db:schema:load

Also be sure to run:

  $ git submodule init && git submodule update

Pivotal Tracker for tasks is here:

Production Server is Amazon EC2.

Staging Server is:
67.202.20.214

http://67.202.20.214

username: admin
password: testit!

== Deployment

You may need to install the capistrano-ext gem:

gem install capistrano-ext

You can then deploy to staging:

cap staging deploy

== Required libraries

* amazon-ec2 version 0.2.6.  WARNING, newer versions do not work:
  
  sudo gem install amazon-ec2 --version "=0.2.6"
  
* capsize

  sudo gem install jnewland-capsize -s http://gems.github.com

Please note the submodules are required to deploy to staging or production:

  git submodule init && git submodule update

NOTE: We removed two submodules:

[submodule "vendor/plugins/count_von_count"]
	path = vendor/plugins/count_von_count
	url = git://github.com/toastyapps/count_von_count

[submodule "vendor/plugins/covalence"]
	path = vendor/plugins/covalence
	url = git://github.com/digitalscientists/covalence.git

So the only submodule we use is the moonshine one.

== Making changes to the server

To add new packages or make configuration changes on the server, please
edit the following files. They contain examples for common configurations.
If you have any questions about how to make a particular change, the Rails
Machine staff is always ready to help.

- config/moonshine.yml

  Use this file to manage configuration related to deploying and
  running the app: domain name, git repos, package dependencies for
  gems, and more.

- app/manifests/application_manifest.rb

  Use this to manage the configuration of everything else on the
  server: define the server 'stack', cron jobs, mail aliases,
  configuration files

== Deploying
 
- config/moonshine.yml
 
  Use this file to manage configuration related to deploying and
  running the app: domain name, git repos, package dependencies for
  gems, and more.
 
- app/manifests/application_manifest.rb
 
  Use this to manage the configuration of everything else on the
  server: define the server 'stack', cron jobs, mail aliases,
  configuration files
 
We're using the multi-stage deployment functionality of the excellent
<tt>capistrano-ext</tt> gem to allow you to separately deploy to your staging
and production server. If you don't already have this gem installed,
please do so by running <tt>sudo gem install capistrano-ext</tt>.

Use <tt>cap staging deploy</tt> to deploy to staging and <tt>cap production
deploy</tt> to update production code.

On every deployment, Moonshine will make sure that all gems, packages, 
and configurations are as specified in <tt>moonshine.yml</tt> and in the
manifest.
